PREPARE FOR BUILD
-----------------
# ./config.sh [install_prefix]

for example:
# ./config.sh $HOME

---------------
BUILD for Linux
---------------
On Debian systems you need the following packages installed to build:
# sudo apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxt-dev libxext-dev libxaw7-dev

# make clean
# make

test the executable:
# bin/ponyprog2000

and install (optional):
# sudo make install

the sudo command is not needed if you install in $HOME


After launching ponyprog it creates ~/.PonyProg2000rc file with all the settings.
You may need to edit it and change
ttyLockDir=/var/lock
The directory where PonyProg creates the lock for serial ports (should be writeable)

ttyDevName=ttyS
Is the name of the serial port device without the trailing number

HtmlBrowseApp=konqueror
Is your html preferred browser (firefox, konqueror, netscape, ...)

-----------------------------
BUILD for Windows using mingw
-----------------------------
You can cross-build from Linux (tested on Ubuntu 12.04) or build from Windows with mingw package installed

# make -f Makefile.win clean
# make -f Makefile.win

You will find ponyprog2000.exe in bin/win

-----------------------------
BUILD for Windows using MSVC
-----------------------------
This is not supported anymore.
